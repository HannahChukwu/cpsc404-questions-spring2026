# Week 3 Question - Chapter 3: Giving Good-Enough Answers

**Student:** Chris Yi
**Date:** February 4, 2026

## Question
Assume that your current project is highly attention-consuming and cannot afford to even make time to give additional "good enough" answers to your boss. How would you construct a "good-enough" answer such a way that would prevent your boss from making additional questions in the future, while not dissatisfying your boss?

## Context
When the boss is satisfied with your "good enough" answers, not only will the boss have a positive attitude towards you, but also likely to *rely* on your answer in the future as well; i.e. the boss will likely to ask you more questions in the future compared to other colleagues.
